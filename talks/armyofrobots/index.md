There's nothing quite like writing code to automate a task. It's like bottled satisfaction for coders. With that in mind, I want to introduce you to GitHub's army of robots. Robots to test our code and deploy. Robots to open doors. Robots to play our music. Robots to record videos of presenters. Robots to serve us beer.

Robots improve quality of life. Robots remove the separation between programmers and designers. They replace managers and large QA departments. They ensure GitHub continues to be a company full of hackers.
