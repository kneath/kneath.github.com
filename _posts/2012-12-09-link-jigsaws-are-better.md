On the subject of repair scheduling:

 > Repairs scheduling is fundamentally flawed. Maintenance companies try to shoehorn irregular shaped jobs into nice, standardised boxes and it leads to appointments being missed and repairs left unfinished. The company wants itsâ€™ customers to be compliant and flexible, but customers need the opposite to be true. So how do we fix the system?

Great article on systems design. The system is more efficient and it makes customers happier. The end result is even simpler than it started:

 > We ask the customer when they want us to turn up and we give operatives all the time and materials they need to complete the right fix.

 Love it.
