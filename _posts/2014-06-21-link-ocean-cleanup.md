Last year, I watched Boyan Slat give a TEDx talk on the subject of plastics in our ocean: [How the oceans can clean themselves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROW9F-c0kIQ). The idea was super interesting to me (I love simple solutions), but I had no idea how feasible it would be. On June 3rd, his newly formed foundation [The Ocean Cleanup](http://www.theoceancleanup.com/) claimed they've proven it is indeed feasible.

They're raising $2,000,000 to deploy a large-scale pilot in the next few years. And maybe it won't work â€” but it sure feels like a no-brainer to donate some money and give them the chance to try.
