# Introducing Knyle Style Sheets

So I've been writing CSS for somewhere around 13 years now. Some might think I've learned the right way to write CSS in that time — but if you ask me all I've learned is the most efficient way to drive someone insane.

CSS is complicated. It's not object oriented. It's not hierarchical. It's a specificity based cascade applied to a dynamic hierarchical data structure that few people truly comprehend. Trying to impart this knowledge on someone is a very difficult task with extremely minimal rewards. I used to think that imparting this knowledge was the path toward writing maintainable CSS within a team.

## Maintainability comes from shared understanding

It's hard to define maintainability. In my eyes it has to do with creating an *shared understanding*. Anyone who's owned an aircooled Volkswagen knows how to adjust valves on any other aircooled Volkswagen. This is because of one of the best technical books ever written: [How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive](http://www.amazon.com/Keep-Volkswagen-Alive-Step-Step/dp/1566913101).

Everyone I know who owned a Bug, Bus, Ghia or Thing owns a copy of this book and *understands* how to work on their car. This book is in large part responsible for that shared understanding.

How can we create a shared understanding with CSS?

## Documentation

For all of the talk of [Object Oriented CSS](https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki), [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/) and pre-processors like [SASS/SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) & [LESS](http://lesscss.org/)... no one is talking about documentation.

Documentation is the key to shared understanding.

## Enter KSS

Inspired by [TomDoc](http://tomdoc.org), [KSS](https://github.com/kneath/kss) attempts to provide a methodology for writing maintainable, documented CSS within a team. Specifically, KSS is a documentation specification and styleguide format. It is not a preprocessor, CSS framework, naming convention, or specificity guideline. This means it works great with ideas like OOCSS, SMACSS, SASS, and LESS.

I've created a [specification](https://github.com/kneath/kss/blob/master/SPEC.md) for KSS as well as a [ruby gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/kss) to parse the documentation.

In a nutshell, KSS looks like this:

{% highlight scss %}
// A button suitable for giving stars to someone.
//
// .star-given - A highlight indicating you've already given a star.
// .disabled   - Dims the button to indicate it cannot be used.
//
// Styleguide 2.2.1.
a.button.star{
  color:#000;

  .star{ font-size:10px; }

  &.star-given{
    color:#ae7e00;
  }

  &.disabled{
    opacity:0.5;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The idea is to write simple, yet machine parseable documentation such that you can automatically create a living styleguide like this one:

<div class="figure">
<a href="http://assets.warpspire.com/images/kss/styleguide-full.png">
  <img src="http://assets.warpspire.com/images/kss/styleguide-thumb.png" alt="Styleguide screencapture" />
 </a>
</div>

## KSS aims to create a shared understanding

I've tried really hard to make sure that KSS is flexible enough to work with as many styles of CSS development as possible. It's purpose is to create a shared understanding through code documentation and styleguides. Not to tell you how to write CSS.

And well. I think that's an important idea. Hope you like it.
