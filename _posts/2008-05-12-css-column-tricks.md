title: Top reasons your CSS columns are messed up
excerpt:
  I believe the recent surge in popularity of CSS frameworks comes from a lack of basic understanding of the CSS box model and how it's implemented across browsers.  I wanted to share with you some quick tips on how to avoid easy pitfalls so you can create your own CSS framework in no time flat, without all the cruft of having ten thousand column combinations available.  Keeping these quick tips in mind at all times will allow you to do something I like to call <em>defensive coding</em> &ndash; and really that's all CSS frameworks are: defensively coded snippets of CSS.

I believe the recent surge in popularity of CSS frameworks comes from a lack of basic understanding of the CSS box model and how it's implemented across browsers.

## Your margins are doubled in IE6

<div class="figure">
<img src="https://assets.warpspire.com/images/css-column-tricks/ie6doublefloat.gif" />
</div>

Here's a super common pitfall: IE6 will double margins facing the direction of the float.  Example problematic code:

{% highlight css %}
.sidebar{
  float:left;
  margin-left:20px;
}
{% endhighlight %}

This sidebar will have a 40px left margin in IE6 -- almost certainly throwing the sidebar down below the content, and not next to the content as it should be.  Easy fix: add `display:inline;`  No side effects in any browser, and IE6 obeys margins perfectly.

{% highlight css %}
.sidebar{
  float:left;
  margin-left:20px;
  display:inline
}
{% endhighlight %}

**Why it works:** By declaring `float` on an element, you implicitly demand that it must be rendered as a block element -- thus rendering the `display:inline` inert.  However, due to IE6's awesome CSS engine, it fixes a bizarre bug that is the #2 reason I see CSS columns fail in IE6.

## Your content is wider than your column

<div class="figure">
<img src="https://assets.warpspire.com/images/css-column-tricks/extendingcolumns.gif" />
</div>

Let's pretend you've got this simplistic setup of code:

{% highlight css %}
.columns{
  width:500px;
}
.columns .main{
  float:left;
  width:400px;
}
.columns .sidebar{
  float:right;
  width:100px;
}
{% endhighlight %}

HTML:

{% highlight html %}
<html>
...
<div class="columns">
  <div class="main">
    <img src="/images/awesome.gif" />
  </div><!-- /.main -->
  <div class="sidebar">
    <p>Sidebar rules!</p>
  </div><!-- /.sidbear -->
</div><!-- /.columns -->
...
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

Harmless right? You might view this in Firefox and everything will be fine. But then you look at it in IE6 and your sidebar has mysteriously dissapeared below `.main`.  WTF? You look at the HTML, the CSS, and everything's fine.  **What could possibly be wrong?**  A common problem here is if `awesome.gif` is 510px wide.  What this does is push out `.main` to 510px, and suddenly there's not enough room for `.sidebar` inside `.columns` any longer.  Ack!

Easy fix: add `overflow:hidden` to your columns.  This forces the width restriction to crop any extruding content.  New magical CSS:

{% highlight css %}
.columns{
  width:500px;
}
.columns .main{
  float:left;
  width:400px;
  overflow:hidden;
}
.columns .sidebar{
  float:right
  width:100px;
  overflow:hidden;
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Your margins extend past your container

<div class="figure">
<img src="https://assets.warpspire.com/images/css-column-tricks/negativemargin.gif" />
</div>

So you're building out a simple product listing template out, and you throw it in an unordered list:

{% highlight css %}
ul.listing{
  margin:0;
  width:400px;
}
ul.listing li{
  list-style-type:none;
  float:left;
  margin:0 20px 0 0;
  width:85px;
}
{% endhighlight %}

HTML:

{% highlight html %}
<html>
...
<ul class="listing">
  <li>Product #1</li>
  <li>Product #2</li>
  <li>Product #3</li>
  <li>Product #4</li>
</ul>
...
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

This CSS will work just fine in something like Firefox, but for mysterious reasons you'll see that Product #4 appears on it's own line in IE6.  What's happening here? I mean 4 columns x 85px + 3 gaps x 20px = 400px, right? Except that your 4th gap is hanging over the right edge -- pushing the true width of the blocks to 420px.  Firefox is smart and lets that margin just hang out there -- but IE6 will apply that margin within the parent wrapper -- throwing the 4th item down since it takes up 20px more than it should have.

The fix? Apply a left margin to each item, with a negative margin to the wrapper.  This means that every item has a visible margin, but the whole block of elements are yanked back by the negative margin:

{% highlight css %}
ul.listing{
  margin:0 0 0 -20px;
  width:420px;
}
ul.listing li{
  list-style-type:none;
  float:left;
  margin:0 0 0 20px;
  width:85px;
}
{% endhighlight %}

This gets around the nasty solution of adding a class to the first or last item in every row -- something I've seen with abundance around the web.

## Building a CSS framework in no time

Wev'e got to start out with some basic HTML.  Here's what I've been using lately:

{% highlight html %}
<html>
...
<div class="columns col2">
  <div class="column first">
    ...
  </div><!-- /.first -->
  <div class="column last">
    ...
  </div><!-- /.last -->
</div><!-- /.columns -->
...
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

For different column widths, I've been changing out the `col2` declaration to things like `col2A, col2B, col2C` and so on. You could easily give them more semantic names like `products-columns` too.

### Self clearing is the future

The first step for any column framework is self-clearing. It's easy, practical, and reduces all those damn clearing divs.

{% highlight css %}
.columns:after {
    content: ".";
    display: block;
    height: 0;
    clear: both;
    visibility: hidden;
}
* html .columns {height: 1%;}
.columns{ display:inline-block; }
.columns{ display:block; }
{% endhighlight %}

### Float those columns

Next step is to actually float those columns. So let's add a couple more declarations:

{% highlight css %}
.columns .column{
  float:left;
  overflow:hidden;
  display:inline;
}
.columns .last{ float:right; }

.col2 .first{ width:500px; }
.col2 .last{ width:100px; }

.col2A .first{ width:400px; }
.col2B .last{ width:200px; }

.col3 .first{ width:100px; }
.col3 .second{ width:280px; margin-left:20px; }
.col3 .last{ width:200px; }
{% endhighlight %}

### Done... uh, what?

Oh, yeah. That's it. That's all it takes to create reliable columns in CSS. Really.
