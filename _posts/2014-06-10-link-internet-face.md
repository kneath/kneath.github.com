Maciej Cegłowski, creator of [pinboard.in](https://pinboard.in):

> I've come to believe that a lot of what's wrong with the Internet has to do with memory. The Internet somehow contrives to remember too much and too little at the same time, and it maps poorly on our concepts of how memory should work.

I can't  begin to explain how insightful and important this phrase is. We've been lazy. We haven't treated backups, privacy, security, and data portability seriously enough as creators of software. It's time we do.

If you build software for the web, you need to read the whole presentation.
