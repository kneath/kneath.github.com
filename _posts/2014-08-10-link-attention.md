Daniel J. Levitin for the Sunday Review:

> Our brains have two dominant modes of attention: the task-positive network and the task-negative network. The task-positive network is active when you’re actively engaged in a task, focused on it, and undistracted. The task-negative network is active when your mind is wandering. These two attentional networks operate like a seesaw in the brain: when one is active the other is not.

I love this explanation. I often find myself arguing for the power of *not* (as in, spending time purposefully not accomplishing tasks). American culture does not like this. It wants us to go faster, do more, always be *on* (why aren't you responding to my text message???). As a creative professional, this pressure can be suffocating and damaging, especially as an organization grows. The worst part? I don't think any of us really want to be this way.

> If we can train ourselves to take regular vacations — true vacations without work — and to set aside time for naps and contemplation, we will be in a more powerful position to start solving some of the world’s big problems. And to be happier and well rested while we’re doing it.

I'd also add a vacation from social media. Take a break from your text messages, your Facebook feed, your Twitter feed, and your Instagram feed. Phone vacations are a real thing, and something we're all going to have to master in our ever-connected world.
