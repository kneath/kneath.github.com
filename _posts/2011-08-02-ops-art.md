summary: Of deploying a major feature on a stage and my love for Hubot.
excerpt:
  A couple months ago I got up on stage during lightening talks  at CodeConf 2011 to talk about our friendly robot, Hubot. Inside of five minutes I logged into our Campfire room with spotty WiFi, asked Hubot a favor, and he deployed a major new feature to our site — Issues 2.0. A deploy spanning around 30 servers that changed a major feature for 800,000 users. It was pretty awesome and kind of a ridiculous thing to do.

A couple months ago I got up on stage during lightening talks  at [CodeConf 2011](http://codeconf.com) to talk about our friendly robot, [Hubot](http://hubot.github.com).

Inside of five minutes I logged into our Campfire room with spotty WiFi, asked Hubot a favor, and he deployed a major new feature to our site — [Issues 2.0](https://github.com/blog/831-issues-2-0-the-next-generation). A deploy spanning around 30 servers that changed a major feature for 800,000 users. It was pretty awesome and kind of a ridiculous thing to do.

Rewind the clock 7 years ago and I had just landed my first steady job in the tech industry — a front end developer for a big interactive agency.

I remember one of our clients had a static HTML website that I was in charge of maintaining. We had a 45 minute window occurring once a week where we could deploy their site.

Once a week, I generated a list of files I'd changed since the last week so a System Administrator could FTP the files over to production. Any changes to production I needed that occurred outside that 45 minute window required manager intervention.

Recap time.

### 2004

* System Administrator time required to deploy every website.
* Deploys scheduled by managers once a week.
* Manually generating lists of changed files.
* Simple deploys take 30+ minutes.

### 2011

* Deploying on stage for the hell of it.
* System Administrator probably drinking whiskey.

2011 is pretty fucking awesome.

Deployment is an art. And the style in which you deploy impacts your company culture more than you think. **Deploy with style.**
