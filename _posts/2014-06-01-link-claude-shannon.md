Claude Shannon, inventor of information theory:

> I don’t know how history is taught here in Japan, but in the United States in my college days, most of the time was spent on the study of political leaders and wars—Caesars, Napoleons, and Hitlers. I think this is totally wrong. The important people and events of history are the thinkers and innovators, the Darwins, Newtons, Beethovens whose work continues to grow in influence in a positive fashion.

The more I learn of Claude Shannon, the more I like this guy. This is the future I want to build. The [entire speech](http://www.inamori-f.or.jp/laureates/K01_b_claude/img/lct_e.pdf) is worth a read.
