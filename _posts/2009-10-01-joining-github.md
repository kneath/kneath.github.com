I still feel like it was last week I decided to [give up my "safe" job at <strike>Web Associates</strike> Level Studios](/features/ch-ch-ch-changes/) to play around with the [ENTP](http://entp.com) crew.  Well, it's time for another move.  Last week I was given an offer I just couldn't refuse--to join the amazing [GitHub](http://github.com) team ([my GitHub profile](http://github.com/kneath)).  For those of you who don't know who GitHub is: shame on you.  GitHub has taken something as boring as source control and made it something that *brings people together*.  Social coding, indeed.

## A brief look at the past couple years

The past couple of years have been a crazy blur of projects for me.  Most of what I did for ENTP was for [redacted], so you won't be seeing most of what I did, but I thought I'd spend a few minutes to archive (for my own good) some of the public-facing projects I completed.

### [Tender](http://tenderapp.com)

By in large, the biggest project I worked on ENTP was [Tender](http://tenderapp.com) -- and I'll be honest, it's going to hurt to let this go.  Tender was my baby, and I did all of the IA, design and front-end work for the site as well as some marketing and analytical work.  The shining side of that tunnel is that of course GitHub [uses Tender](http://support.github.com) for their support, so I'll at least get to use it and see how ENTP shapes the product.

### [Lighthouse iPhone](http://iphone.lighthouseapp.com)

<div class="figure"><a href="http://iphone.lighthouseapp.com"><img src="http://assets.warpspire.com/images/github/lighthouse_iphone.jpg" alt="Lighthouse iPhone Screenshots" /></a></div>

Designing an iPhone optimized interface was one of my first projects at ENTP.  It doesn't benefit from any of the OS 2.0+ features (HTML5, CSS Animations, Etc) since the code was created before these came along, but it gets the job done.  It was a great exploration in turning a complicated interface and trimming it down to the bare essentials.

### [ENTP.com](http://entp.com)

<div class="figure"><a href="http://entp.com"><img src="http://assets.warpspire.com/images/github/entp.jpg" alt="ENTP.com Screenshot" /></a></div>

I designed this in collaboration with Justin Palmer when ENTP decided they needed a new site.  It's got a few interesting features (like pulling in our current GitHub projects on demand in the footer), but it's mostly just a brochure site for the agency.

### [Hoth](http://hoth.entp.com)

<div class="figure"><a href="http://hoth.entp.com"><img src="http://assets.warpspire.com/images/github/entp_hoth.jpg" alt="Hoth Screenshot" /></a></div>

Hoth is ENTP's blog.  This design accompanied the new ENTP.com design and added in a bit of tumble-like functionality to the templates.

## On to the next chapter

So now I enter the third dream job I've had in the 4 years since I graduated college (none of which have been slightly related to my degree). I'll be diving into a design/front-end role for the team and help clean up and take the product to the next level.

I'll see ya'll at the next GitHub drinkup.
