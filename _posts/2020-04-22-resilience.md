title: Toward a more resilient future
---

It's been about seventeen years now that this website has been my little corner of the internet. It's gone through a few different iterations in those years — some sarcastic, some serious, and some arbitrarily personal. Many of those iterations are lost to poorly exported databases, absolute positioning, and the whims of [archive.org](https://archive.org). So it goes.

I've wanted a new Warpspire for a while now, but I've been at a loss as to what it should be. My initial instinct was to start with the content, because that's the best way to build anything important. So I wrote. I made outlines, collected notes, revised drafts. I thought hard about where I wanted to go in life — no — where I _should_ go in life. I wrote more. I kept iterating. None of it ever felt right.

But you know, Warpspire isn't important. I forgot that. I don't think there's anything of purposeful value here. I've made some good arguments and some bad arguments, but there's nothing on this site that is revolutionary or essential. When Warpspire has been at it's best, it's been a place just for me — not a thing _for_ anyone else. I'm not really an expert. Not a genius. I'm just someone figuring out the world through my own eyes.

My world has changed pretty drastically over the past few years. Or is it a decade? I don't even know anymore. I'm not sure it matters. Here's the thing: the **entire world** has changed in the past ten weeks. Whatever comes next is going to be different.

It feels like time for a new Warpspire. Not a version I'd planned, those are archived for the ages. Something actually new. This time I know exactly what it should be: it's a website that doesn't know what it is yet. It doesn't even have navigation. Or more than one post. It will! But not for now.

It feels very much like the world right now. We had a lot of ideas that weren't working very well. So much of our world was just teetering on the edge of failure. Then the whole cliff fell out from under us. We find ourselves Wile E. Coyote floating in the air above a cliff that isn't there anymore. We haven't started to fall yet, but it's not like the cliff is going to come back any time soon.

Yes, all of the old links work. I am not a monster. The world changes, but it always remembers.

We have some scary times ahead. But a reset does present a lot of opportunity. Opportunity for growth. Opportunity for corruption. Opportunity for failure. Opportunity for something new. I want that something new to be more resilient. I don't know what that is. I only have fragments. I guess that's kind of what I want this website to be for now. Fragments toward a more resilient future.

## Fragments

Can we take whatever this hamster-wheel idea that is The Economy, mash it up in a blender, and come out the other side with a hamster-wheel that pushes toward a healthier planet and a better society?

- Healthy
- Educated
- Food. Water. Shelter.

We should do these things because they are good things to do. It does not matter how much it costs, whether people deserve it, who qualifies as a person — these are distractions. It matters that we believe it is right. If it is right and it is possible, we should do it.

All of this: Kim Stanley Robinson on [Making the Fed’s Money Printer Go Brrrr for the Planet](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-04-22/kim-stanley-robinson-let-the-fed-print-money-for-the-planet)

We have plenty of work for people to do. Work that is far more fulfilling than running in the hamster wheel of the economy. The New New Deal? The Green New Deal? Who cares what we call it. We have a lot of interesting work that would be good for the planet and its people. And we just don't do it? I've never understood that. What if we did those good things because they are good?

This is a very complicated question. I do not have the answers. I really wish I did.

The _Future of Work_ is a very real thing right now. Not in that silly way Venture Capitalists talk about it: when an employer forces you to use a website, that doesn't mean it's the future of work. That's just a website. Sorry.

The current state of work is rapidly morphing into a new hierarchy of classes. The Owners. The Work-From-Home. The Warehouse Shufflers. The Line Cooks. The Delivery Drivers. This is a scary look. It does not fill my heart with good feelings.

There are promising looks! Many who work from home now always could have. We never needed to commute. And we sure didn't need that massive office building. It turns out that yes, most meetings could have been emails. Most emails need never have been sent. We never needed to fill our air with pollutants. We can do all kinds of work just fine without burning millions of gallons of jet fuel.

John Roderick and Merlin Mann in [Garbage Island](http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/ep-379-garbage-island.html). An introvert revolt! Load up the office with mylar balloons — I'm staying at home. I love it.

> The Extroverts are not the problem. And the problem with the Introverts is that we think the Extroverts are the problem. And the problem with Extroverts is that they don't think about Introverts at all.

The _Future of Living_ is another thing I think about a lot. You can live your life without ever coming into contact with the act of living these days. Washing your sheets. Gardening. Cooking. Building a deck. Sweeping the floor.

_There is inherent value in spending more time in the act of living._ It is likely to be the antidote for the anxiety of the modern world. This is a troubled thesis and needs a lot of work.
