title: What I'm Doing Now

This is what I’m doing now. In the style of [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com/about).

***Last updated:** October 12, 2021 from Palm Springs, CA.*

## Building A House

In 2019, I bought an empty plot of land in South Lake Tahoe to build a house. Since then I dove into books about functional architecture (like [Patterns of Home](https://www.amazon.com/Patterns-Home-Essentials-Enduring-Design/dp/156158696X)), picked up [SketchUp](https://sketchup.com/), and worked with [Sierra Sustainable Builders](https://www.sierrasustainable.com/) to design a house of my dreams. Now they're turning it into a real thing in the world!

## Investing Local

While most of my peers have chosen to invest mostly in technology startups, my interests pushed me toward local businesses. I want to see fewer franchises in the world, and more locally owned & operated small businesses. In 2020, I invested in [Refuge Coffee](https://refugecoffee.com/), and in 2021 Jessica & I bought an [old gas station](https://www.google.com/maps/place/986+Emerald+Bay+Rd,+South+Lake+Tahoe,+CA+96150/@38.9136127,-120.0072509,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x80998fba6f69437f:0x716634f92ce30e3d!8m2!3d38.9136085!4d-120.0050569) to develop into what I'm calling a *Gas Station of the Future*. I hope to share more on what that means soon.

## Writing

Writing has always brought me solace, and I’ve been trying to publish more of it lately. Most of it ends up either [here at Warpspire](https://warpspire.com/), or in my occasional personal newsletter, [Seasons of Kyle](https://buttondown.email/kneath).

## Giving

Since Microsoft acquired GitHub, I found myself in an unexpected situation: wealthy. I don't really care about legacy, so I try to give money away to people and organizations that can put it to good use. My goal is to donate more money than I spend on myself to non-profits each year and give away my [lifetime gift tax exemption](https://www.schwab.com/resource-center/insights/content/giving-while-living-do-you-understand-gift-tax) to friends & family while I’m still alive.

## Enjoying Retirement

Truth be told, I am not pushing that hard. I'm not interested in [cranking](https://www.43folders.com/2011/04/22/cranking) anymore. I'd rather spend my time reading or enjoying the mountains with [Jessica](https://twitter.com/jlsuttles/). Maybe that's felling trees at my off-grid property, [Leaping Daisy](https://www.instagram.com/explore/locations/1739674376255530/united-states/pioneer-california/leaping-daisy-meadows/). Snowboarding at [Kirkwood](https://www.kirkwood.com/). Riding my [Nomad](https://www.santacruzbicycles.com/en-US/bikes/nomad) up Tahoe Mountain. Backpacking in [Desolation Wilderness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desolation_Wilderness).

Then again, sometimes I'm just enjoying the pool in Palm Springs, my home-away-from-home. I did tell you I was retired, didn't I?
