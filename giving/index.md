title: Giving
---

When I first started giving to charities, I didn't really know what I was doing. I gave random amounts of money away to organizations that happened to float into my attention. That's a good way to start! Giving money to others is always better than hoarding it for some perfect some day when you've <em>figured it all out</em>.

Now I sit down once a year and make a plan. I list out charities and amounts I will give to throughout the year. I take 1% of my net worth at the beginning of the year and distribute it across local, carbon, and social good charities from my [donor advised fund](https://vanguardcharitable.org). I'll probably change this strategy in the future, but right now it works well for me. It's allowed me to give away 6% of my net worth so far, with an additional 21% set aside for future giving. That's <strong>27%</strong> of my net worth set aside for charity, which I feel is pretty good!

These are the non-profits I regularly support, and a little context for why I like them. They're not all perfect, but I think they're doing good.

## Tahoe Local

I'm a big believer in your local community, so a lot of the non-profits I give to are doing good things around Tahoe (and other places I frequent). You'll see a lot of the charities align with access to wilderness and getting kids opportunities to explore the outdoors. I was fortunate enough that my Dad brought me to the Sierra a lot when I was a kid (camping used to be a cheap vacation), and I'm constantly thankful for growing up knowing how much joy is found in our public lands. Public lands are what make the West magical.

  <h3><a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/">Strong Towns</a></h3>
  <p>Okay, this isn't strictly a <em>Tahoe</em> thing, but it's an <em>every town</em> thing. Strong Towns builds an actionable framework for making our towns more resilient and prosperous. Do you like downtowns? Bikes? Tree-lined streets? Outdoor dining? Small, locally owned shops? You'll probably like Strong Towns.</p>

  <h3><a href="https://tamba.org/">Tahoe Area Mountain Bike Association</a></h3>
  <p>Have you ever heard of <strong>Toad's Wild Ride</strong> or <strong>Flume Trail</strong>? TAMBA is behind all of the incredible mountain biking trails we have around the lake. I'm happy to support any organization giving people more access the natural beauty of our mountains.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <h3><a href="https://sierratrails.org/">Sierra Buttes Trail Stewardship</a></h3>
  <p>SBTS was crucial in helping TAMBA become the organization it is today. Their support in learning how to navigate relationships with land managers to actually build trail cannot be overstated. And of course, they build trail too. Their <a href="https://sierratrails.org/connected-communities/">connected communities</a> vision is one of the most ambitious trail-focused projects I've ever seen. As someone with a soft spot for California mountain towns, I look forward to seeing it to fruition.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
  <h3><a href="https://chilelagoslimpios.cl/en/">Chile Lagos Limpios</a></h3>
  <p>CLL is a sister organization to The League. Chile is facing a lot of the same challenges that Tahoe faces - climate change, industry, and increased development are threatening the clarity and health of their lakes. The hope is that we can learn from each other - trading science, tools, successes, and failures. Tahoe has spent over $2 billion to save our lake, and we still see yearly impacts from mistakes like Tahoe Keys. Hopefully we can help Chile learn from our mistakes – and make better decisions as more and more people move to this incredible part of their country.</p>

  <h3><a href="https://www.clean-tahoe.org/">Clean Tahoe Program</a></h3>
  <p>Clean Tahoe provides a fairly simple service: they make sure trash ends up at the dump (and not in our forests and neighborhoods). We live in a magnificently beautiful place, and Clean Tahoe helps maintain that.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <h3><a href="https://savebears.org/">The BEAR League</a></h3>
  <p>Almost every time I meet someone from out of town, they ask me: <em>do you ever see bears?</em> It's kind of a funny question, beacause of course I do. Almost every day. Bears are a part of live in the Sierra. Unfortunately, humans aren't always the best at co-existing with bears, and that's what The BEAR League works to improve.</p>

  <li>
  <h3><a href="https://ltwc.org/">Lake Tahoe Wildlife Care</a></h3>

  <p>The Tahoe Bike Coalition works to improve biking inside our cities around Tahoe. They advocate for bike friendly traffic design, offer bike valet at events, and help people fix their bikes through their bike kitchens. I've said it many times, and I'll say it again: biking by default is the best way to get around Tahoe.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <h3><a href="https://www.guidestar.org/profile/30-0673247">Friends of Ski Run</a></h3>

Friends of Ski Run is the organization they've used to enact tactical urbanism on Ski Run Blvd in South Lake. They've been able to carve out special zoning exemptions to allow <a href="http://www.skirunfarmersmarket.com/">farmer's markets</a>, <a href="https://tahoebrewfest.com/">brewfests</a>, <a href="https://www.longestdinnertabletahoe.com/">community dinners</a>, and just this year opened up a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DB6Wp-xSxb4/?hl=en&img_index=1">community-built park</a>. It's hard to describe the community The Friends been able to foster in South Lake — it's truly something special to have a community interested in making their town better and <em>actually doing it</em>. We need more Friends of Ski Run in America.</p>

## Carbon Removal & Sequestration

The planet isn't doing so good as of late. These are a few organizations I think are helping us prepare for a future where we'll take carbon removal seriously.

<ul class="itemized">
  <li>
  <h3><a href="https://carbon180.org/">Carbon 180</a></h3>
  <p>Carbon180 is dedicated to educating the public and policymakers on the best, most viable solutions for carbon removal. They are an incredible resource in everything climate — and the first place I'd direct anyone looking for how to help.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <h3><a href="https://protectourwinters.org/">Protect Our Winters</a></h3>
  <p>POW is a climate-change focused organization, built around the concept of <strong>The Outdoor State</strong> — unifying all of us who consider the outdoors our playground.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <h3><a href="https://www.coolearth.org/">Cool Earth Action</a></h3>
  <p>Cool Earth works with rainforest communities to stop deforestation, helping them build financial resilience so they are under less pressure to cut their forest under a crisis. Far more effective than planting trees — saving our existing rainforests is critical to slow the advance of climate change.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <h3><a href="https://trees.org">Trees for the Future</a></h3>
  <p>TREES works with farmers around the world to implement their Forest Garden Approach to combat deforestation from agriculture. Their system uses trees to grow fruits and vegetables while adding nutrients back into the soil — a win for carbon sequestration and agricultural productivity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <h3><a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/">Sierra Club</a></h3>
  <p>The Sierra Club believes that everyone has a right to a healthy world, and fights for that right through advocacy across a large number of topics — from endangered species protection, to national park protection, to shutting down coal-fired energy plants.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <h3><a href="https://drawdown.org/">Drawdown</a></h3>
  <p>Do you ever wish we had a big list of things to do in order to combat climate change? That's exactly what Project Drawdown is. I have a feeling this is going to be valuable in the future.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <h3><a href="https://theoceancleanup.com/">The Ocean Cleanup</a></h3>
  <p>Every decade or so, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_garbage_patch">The Great Pacific Garbage Patch</a> hits the news — a floating gyre of plastic about twice the size of Texas floating in the ocean. The Ocean Cleanup builds technology to harvest plastic from this patch, as well as innovating systems along rivers to prevent new plastic from getting there in the first place.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <h3><a href="https://www.catf.us/">Clean Air Task Force</a></h3>
  <p>The CATF is laser focused on creating a zero-emissions, high-energy world. I can get behind that.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

## Social Good

I don't really know what to call this category, but I've settled on _social good_. It's organizations that do things like combat global poverty, prevent people from dying, or builds some kind of super valuable free infrastructure for the world.

<ul class="itemized">
  <li>
  <h3><a href="https://www.givewell.org/">GiveWell</a></h3>
  <p>GiveWell is at the heart of the <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/doing-good-better-how-effective-altruism-can-help-you-help-others-do-work-that-matters-and-make-smarter-choices-about-giving-back/9781592409662?aid=613">Effective Altruism</a> movement in philanthropy, an evidence-based approach to pick effective charities around the world. I'm very far from an expert in poverty or global health, so I'm thankful GiveWell exists to maximize my impact without becoming an expert.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <h3><a href="https://www.givedirectly.org/">GiveDirectly</a></h3>
  <p>GiveDirectly has a bold, simple view on how to combat poverty: give people money. That's it. You give them money, they pass it along to people living in poverty. Unsurprisingly, it's incredibly effective.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <h3><a href="https://donate.wikimedia.org/">Wikipedia</a></h3>
  <p>Imperfect as it may be, I can think of few websites as valuable as Wikipedia.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <h3><a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a></h3>
  <p>Most people know of the Internet Archive as the people who make the <a href="https://web.archive.org/">Wayback Machine</a>, but did you know they also a <a href="https://openlibrary.org/">free digital lending library</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/software">vintage software archive</a>, and a whole host of <a href="https://archive.org/details/etree">live music shows</a>? </p>
  </li>
</ul>
