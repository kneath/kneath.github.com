title: Against Increasing the Speed Limit Inside South Lake Tahoe
---

> This is a public comment submitted to the City of South Lake Tahoe regarding Item 15 on the [June 20th agenda](https://docs.google.com/gview?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgranicus_production_attachments.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fslt%2F5089f58293d6312485eca9123d20a9a40.pdf&embedded=true).

I'm writing in to comment on Item 15 — Caltrans' suggestion to increase the speed limit along the Highway 50/89 corridor in South Lake Tahoe.

I am a long time resident of Gardner Mountain. I spend almost every day driving, biking, and walking along this corridor. I also own commercial property at the Y (Runnels), and am currently in the process of redeveloping it because I believe the Y holds tremendous potential for South Lake Tahoe. I strongly oppose this increase and argue for a reduction from the current speed limits.

I have reviewed the Caltrans reports for raising the speed limit, and found that they rely on two metrics for justification: accident rate relative to state average (ACC/VM), and 85th percentile actual speed of vehicle travel. Absent from these reports is the most important metric: level of traffic stress (LTS). I believe without a study utilizing LTS, this report is inadequate for changes within South Lake Tahoe. LTS is the most important metric for how streets affect towns — steering the vibrancy of businesses and quality of life for residents. A low level of traffic stress means people spend more time out of their cars, visit more shops, spend more time in public spaces, and develop stronger relationships with their neighbors. These are all things I want to see for South Lake Tahoe.

The "Y" area in South Lake Tahoe has gone through dramatic changes over the past decade. It's almost unrecognizable from 2010 in the best way possible. It's been nicknamed "the local's downtown" for good reason — there are dozens of stores, restaurants, and a constant stream of community events all within the few blocks surrounding the intersection. People walk, bike, drive, one-wheel, scooter, visit friends, commute to school, and patronize businesses every day along these streets. The adjoining neighborhood Gardner Mountain is home to some of the highest percentage of full-time residents in all of South Lake Tahoe. Children from the High School cross 50 and 89 every day. This is a place where people live. Highway 50/89 is not a thoroughfare here — it is a main street.

Increasing the amount of vehicle stress goes against every success the Y has enjoyed in recent years. It is the number one enemy of creating a downtown. The rate of pedestrian and cyclist deaths for every 5mph increase over 25mph is well documented and need not be revisited. But I do think it is worth noting that state-owned roads inside of city limits have had a poor safety record as of late. The NHTSA data shows that since 2015 state-owned (Caltrans) roadways have dramatically increased their share of traffic deaths.

I would like to see all roads — including those owned by Caltrans — within the city limits reduced to 25mph and traffic calming measures implemented to reduce actual speed traveled. I believe this is vital to South Lake's future if we wish to have a true "downtown" feeling to our city and reduce traffic stress for drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists alike. 

Additionally, increased speeds will not solve traffic delays. A 45mph speed limit along 89 will not get you to Emerald Bay faster when cars are traveling at 5mph along Camp Richardson one mile down the road. But it might increase the road rage a visitor experiences due to such a dramatic slowdown. Traffic delays in South Lake Tahoe are caused by congestion, snow removal operations, and road work — all things made safer by a lower speed limit.

I urge Caltrans and the city to visit similar mountain towns with highways cutting through them like Durango, CO and see how the reduction in speed limits has benefitted businesses, residents, and made the town extremely pleasant to visit — primarily through LTS based approaches.

This report on [Durango's Road Diets](https://www.flydurango.com/DocumentCenter/View/7932/College-and-8th-Traffic-Study?bidId=) serves as a good example of a LTS approach to traffic design.

ACC/VM and 85th percentile speed measures are adequate metrics for empty stretches of thoroughfare highway. They are inadequate for roadways inside of cities, and they are inadequate for South Lake Tahoe.
