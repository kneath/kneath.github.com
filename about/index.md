# Kyle Neath

<p class="intro">
  My name is Kyle Neath and I work at <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> in San Francisco. I love to build beautiful things with software.

I love to build the future. I believe software will effect a Change in this world (and beyond), and I am going to be part of it. I'm not a deisgner. Not a programmer. Not a manager. I went to school for [Civil Engineering](http://assets.warpspire.com/images/site/degree.jpg), but ended up building things with software instead.

I work on product at GitHub. We're creating a better way to design, build, and ship software.
