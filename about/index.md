Hi, my name is **Kyle Aster** (previously Kyle Neath) and this is my home on the internet. I've been publishing Warpspire [since 2003](https://web.archive.org/web/20031230052204/http://www.warpspire.com/), and throughout that time it's held many different shapes — right now it's a bit of a blog and a bit of a public notebook.

Professionally, it's easiest to say I'm a retired digital product designer. I shouldn't need to work for anyone ever again. But I keep busy — right now I'm focused on investing in my local community: nonprofits, businesses, and most recently — commercial property development.

If you are interested in keeping up with my personal life, I send out an occasional newsletter I call [_Seasons of Kyle_](https://buttondown.email/kneath/).

## I used to do a lot with computers

I don't remember a lot about how I became interested in computers — I just remember them always being around. My elementary school had a computer lab full of Apple IIs that I remember playing [Number Munchers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_Munchers), [Pizza to Go](https://www.mobygames.com/game/pizza-to-go) and all sorts of funny little "educational" games on. I also remember the school getting a special grant to have an internet lab around 1993 where we downloaded recipes from [Gopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)), and more notably — spent hours very slowly downloading images from Hubble with Mosaic. Space! It's a hell of a drug.

By the time I was in middle school, I was building websites for Warcraft II on Tripod and [Angelfire](https://www.angelfire.com/ak/locher/) — Made with Mac GIFS, keyword stuffing and all. By high school (~2000) I was building websites for a couple non-profits and my Dad's construction business and finally landed my first paid gig: photographs and a website for [poisonous lizards](https://www.helodermahorridum.com/). Yes, they tried to bite me.

In 2001, I became obsessed with [Utopia](http://dominion.opendominion.net/) and [Dominion](http://dominion.opendominion.net/) — online turn-based strategy games that required you to log in every hour to play your turn in real time. Because of this, I picked up my first programming language — ASP 3.0 — and started to build my own game with a couple of friends: [Nightfire](https://github.com/kneath/nightfire/). We never finished the game, but it was the motivator to learn all about databases, server-side programming, and HTML & CSS.

**Fun fact:** Nightfire was actually the origin of this domain, warpspire.com — blame 13 year old Kyle for why it doesn't make any sense.

In 2002, I graduated high school and went off to [Cal Poly](https://www.calpoly.edu/) to major in Civil Engineering. To pay the bills, I kept working on Stepmom's gallery site and maintained the Civil Engineering department's site.

By 2004, my tuition had quadrupled and Arnold Schwarzenegger was now my governor.  Cool.

So when I wasn't in class, I just kept building websites. I built websites on contract. I maintained websites for hourly wages. I built Amazon and Zzounds affiliate websites. I built [Wordpress themes](https://warpspire.com/hemingway/) and made money off Dreamhost affiliate links. I built and re-built my blog a dozen times. And along the way I learned all manners of web technologies. I had a firm grasp on HTML, CSS and web standards. I could write enough PHP to do just about anything I could imagine. And I was almost making enough money to pay my ever-increasing tuition (and books, and rent, and…). So I also got a job at Subway.

This is all to say, I never really had a plan. I just wanted to make rent and stay in school. So when [Web Associates](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/web-associates) called me up for an interview in 2004 and offered me $12/hr for as many hours as I could work, I was ecstatic. I spent the next 4 years there working on projects for Apple, RIM, Oakley, Disney, Motorola, and Hewlett-Packard. I built things in ColdFusion, in Java, in ASP.NET — with XSL and WPF and probably a handful of technologies I've erased from my brain.

By the time I graduated with my degree in Civil Engineering in 2007, I had already found a job a loved working with people I enjoyed spending time with. So I decided to just keep Doing Computers™.

* * * *

In the end, big agency life wasn't for me. I left Web Associates in 2008 and worked at a small consultancy named [ENTP](http://entp.com/) led by [@court3nay](https://twitter.com/court3nay) (who I'd met through `#caboose`). I worked on a mix of client work and product development during my time there, most notably working with [@technoweenie](http://techno-weenie.net/) to design, build out, and grow the first version of [Tender](https://tenderapp.com).

![Tender Homepage I designed](https://assets.warpspire.com/images/about/tenderapp.jpg)

In 2009, I moved to San Francisco and through old 9Rules and `#caboose` connections I ended up getting a job offer from [GitHub](https://github.com) as the first design hire. That kind of set the tone for the rest of my professional career. It was the epitome of what I wanted to work on: full time on a product funded by subscriptions, not ad revenue. And so the next five years of my life got absorbed in building out the company and the product that everyone now knows as GitHub.

![A piece of the GitHub Zen: Anything added dillutes everything else](https://assets.warpspire.com/images/about/github-zen.jpg)

In 2014, I left San Francisco and GitHub to help care for my dad who was suffering from cerebellar ataxia. It wasn't how I expected to leave, but in the end I think it was good for me. I loved GitHub, but I just wasn't built to thrive in large organizations.

* * * *

Lucky for me — that whole GitHub thing ended up being [pretty financially lucrative](https://news.microsoft.com/announcement/microsoft-acquires-github/) and has allowed me to reach escape velocity from capitalism and ask myself _what exactly is it you want to do with your life?_ 

I've slowly come to the realization that I kind of don't care about Building Stuff With Computers any longer. So I've turned my focuses more local and more physical — investing in local businesses and trying to make South Lake the best little mountain town it can be. Most recently, Jessica and I are trying something new: commercial property development. Planning department willing — we'll be turning an old gas station into a beautiful cafe built for people, not cars.

We're calling it _A Gas Station For The Future_. It'll be a while.

## Stuff I built with computers

I've been able to work with some seriously smart individuals throughout my career, and as a result, I've been a part of some really exciting projects. These are some I'm most proud of.

### [The Pull Request](https://github.com/blog/712-pull-requests-2-0)

GitHub had pull requests well before I joined, but at the time they were little more than [a button that sent a message](https://github.com/blog/3-oh-yeah-there-s-pull-requests-now). I was able to pair up with [@rtomayko](http://2ndscale.com/) and [@schacon](http://scottchacon.com/) to revisit pull requests and make them first-class citizens in the product.

We looked at some commonly used strategies for reviewing code in Git, and tried our best to marry them to GitHub's collaboration & discussion features. We shipped the foundation for pull requests with [Compare View](https://github.com/blog/612-introducing-github-compare-view), and iterated on our ideas until we ended up with first-class pull requests: [Pull Requests 2.0](https://github.com/blog/712-pull-requests-2-0).

To this day, Pull Requests are my favorite thing I've ever worked on. It was incredible watching the feature grow from our need for better code review to the power-house feature that sits at the core of GitHub today.

### [GitHub Organizations](https://github.com/blog/674-introducing-organizations)

When I joined GitHub, the site only allowed personal accounts. My first big project was tackling the design for Organizations — our answer to shared accounts for businesses and open source teams.

Organizations were more successful than I would have imagined, and grew into one of the most critical features of the site, having a tremendous impact on the growth of the business along the way.

### [GitHub for Mac](https://github.com/blog/878-announcing-github-for-mac)

We knew early on at GitHub that one of our biggest barriers to growth was the same force that fueled so much of our growth: Git. Git was designed first and foremost for the command line — and the command line can be a scary place. As time went on, it became more and more obvious that we needed to solve this problem ourselves. This is how the idea for [GitHub for Mac](https://mac.github.com) was born.

I was fortunate enough to work along side [@joshaber](https://joshaber.github.io/) to build out 1.0. You can read more about that process in my article [Designing GitHub for Mac](http://warpspire.com/posts/designing-github-mac).

### [GitHub Jobs](https://github.com/blog/687-github-jobs-pre-launch)

Early on, we explored a few different ideas for companion products to GitHub, one of which was trying to connect employers with developers seeking work. I worked with [@pjhyett](http://hyett.com/), [@defunkt](https://github.com/defunkt), and [@rtomayko](http://2ndscale.com) to design, re-design, and ship the first version of [GitHub Jobs](https://jobs.github.com).

Jobs ended up being one of the more interesting products I've worked on for an odd reason: I think it might be the most efficient software project I've ever participated in. We were able to build out the initial version in just a couple of weeks, it required very little maintenance, and enjoyed a lasting success. It's not the most ground-breaking product, but not everything needs to be.

### [KSS](/posts/kss/) (Knyle Style Sheets)

As the company grew, my focus shifted from development to building out our design team. This shift inspired [KSS](https://github.com/kneath/kss), a tool to document CSS and automate the creation of style guides. KSS has gone on to become much more popular than I'd imagined, and is by far my most popular open source project (even eclipsing Hemingway!).

I'm just happy people are finally documenting their CSS.
