Here's the deal: comments on the internet **suck**.  You know what I mean. Between the [trolls](http://www.isthereaproblem.com/), the spam, the idiots, and general fuckwads — the experience sucks for everyone involved.

But some of the most amazing people I've met in my life I've met through my website. So I think ignoring *everyone's* feedback sucks. And I think there's a lot of value in sharing reader commentary. This is my attempt at preserving that connection to awesome people while keeping the trolls away.

I'm taking the high tech approach and asking people to email me instead.  No more anonimity. No more public audience by default. Just you talking to me — and isn't that how it should always be?

<a href="mailto:kneath+ask@gmail.com" class="askme">Ask me anything, just send an email to <strong>kneath+ask@gmail.com</strong></a>

Be polite, be reasonable and I'll respond back. And if I think it's something my audience might be interested in, I'll post it to the site for all to see.
