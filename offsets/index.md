title: Offsets
---

I often oscillate between blissful ignorance and being consumed by the idea that the world is ending as a result of human-caused climate change. Admittedly, it's not exactly ending. But it is becoming quite uncomfortable for humans. One thing I do is try to offset my personal carbon emissions.

I estimate that my carbon footprint is in the ballpark of **3 tons/mo**. The average American's footprint is about 2 tons/mo. My income is high, I own several houses, rarely fly, primarily drive an electric car / walk, have some rooftop solar... so I've settled on 3 tons/mo. The important part to remember is it's really just a guess. I'd say my actual footprint lies somewhere between 1-20 tons/mo.

The next step is to figure out who to purchase offsets from. This is a cursed activity. The whole industry of carbon offsets is filled with nuance, constantly-shifting consensus, bleeding-edge science, and fraudsters that aren't very good at removing carbon but are quite adept at separating people and their money. The [CDR (Carbon Dioxide Removal) database](https://carbonplan.org/research/cdr-database) over at (carbon)plan is a good place to get started and understand some of the variables involved. I would suggest starting with the [metrics](https://carbonplan.org/research/cdr-database/methods) they use to rank projects.

Ideally, I'd like to be removing 3 tons/mo, and preventing 30 tons/mo from being released. My thinking is that I'm _pretty sure_ the 3 tons/mo is carbon that would have otherwise not been removed, and it's _probably likely_ the 30 tons/mo is carbon that would have otherwise not been removed. Another way to look at this strategy is to say I'm removing the actual carbon I'm emitting, and as a backup I'm sponsoring someone else from emitting 10x my estimated emissions. I'm really just trying to make sure I'm not making things worse.

I've also chosen a diverse portfolio of offset providers. I'm not entirely sure any single provider is reliably removing the carbon they claim, and I'm certain there isn't one that is capable of scaling to meet the moment we're in right now. Something something, don't put all your eggs in one basket.

Every month, I spend **$1,500.00** on carbon offsets that remove **1.4 tons of CO2** and prevent **36.7 tons of CO2-equivalent** from being released.

## High Quality Removal Projects

I have high confidence these projects permanently remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere that otherwise would not have been removed without creating emissions elsewhere.

<ul class="nonprofits">
  <li>
  <h3><a href="https://climeworks.com/invitation/Jy04DG0A">Climeworks</a> $500/mo for 0.5 tons</h3>
  <p>Climeworks builds DAC (Direct Air Capture) machines that use geothermal energy to suck carbon dioxide out of the air and store it the bedrock below. These are by far the most robust and effective offsets available, however they are extremely costly and the technology is only effective in very specific geographic areas.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <h3><a href="https://charmindustrial.com/">Charm Industrial</a> $500/mo for 0.9 tons</h3>
  <p>Charm Industrial uses a process called BCCS (Biomass Carbon Capture and Storage) to turn plant residue into an oil which is then injected underground. This is one of the most promising technologies for scaling carbon offsets, but is still quite expensive.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

## High Quality Avoidance Projects

I have high confidence these projects permanently prevent greenhouse gasses from being released that otherwise would have been released due to inaction.

<ul class="nonprofits">
  <li>
  <h3><a href="https://tradewater.us">Tradewater</a> $500/mo for 36.7 tons</h3>
  <p>Tradewater searches out refrigerants (like say and old refrigerator in a dump), collects the chemicals, and destroys them before the refrigerants (which are powerful greenhouse gasses) can be released into the atmosphere. [Refrigerant Management](https://drawdown.org/solutions/refrigerant-management) has long been a staple of Project Drawdown.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

## Promising Projects

I have hopes that these projects either temporarily prevent greenhouse gasses from being released, or provide a framework toward a carbon-negative process. I have invested or otherwise donated to these organizations, and I like what they're doing.

<ul class="nonprofits">
  <li>
  <h3><a href="https://www.worldtree.eco/">WorldTree / Eco-Tree</a></h3>
  <p>WorldTree has patented a specific variety of Empress Tree, notable for its extremely fast growth rate. They partner with farmers to grow these trees and harvest them for lumber and biomass sales. If combined with BECCS (Bioenergy and Carbon Capture and Sequestration), this could result in a durable market that continually sequestered carbon from the atmosphere. There are significant logistical challenges to make this process actually carbon negative.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <h3><a href="https://www.coolearth.org/">Cool Earth Action</a></h3>
  <p>Cool Earth works with rainforest communities to stop deforestation, helping them build financial resilience so they are under less pressure to cut their forest under a crisis. Preventing the removal of rainforests is a critical avoidance strategy, unfortunately rainforests can always be removed in the future, and existing rainforests do not sequester new carbon at scale.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <h3><a href="https://trees.org">Trees for the Future</a></h3>
  <p>TREES works with farmers around the world to implement silvopasture methods (trees + crops) to build soil and grow food without chemical fertilizers. Carbon is sequestered in the soil life as well as in the trees grown â€” unfortunately the carbon can be released if the land is no longer farmed, and sequestration happens only once for any given piece of land.</p>
